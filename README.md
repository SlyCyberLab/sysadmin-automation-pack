## üîß Project Overview

This toolkit contains three foundational scripts designed to simulate real-world sysadmin tasks and demonstrate essential Linux administration skills. Each script addresses critical aspects of system security, monitoring, and maintenance that are essential in enterprise environments.

**Core Components:**
1. **User Security Baseline** ‚Äì Lock unused system accounts, enforce password policies, and create hardened user templates
2. **Service Monitor** ‚Äì Track and restart critical services (e.g. SSH, firewalld) using systemctl + cron
3. **Package Audit Script** ‚Äì Identify and optionally clean outdated packages and stale caches using DNF

All scripts were developed and tested on **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5** and demonstrate production-ready automation techniques.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.5 or compatible distribution
- Bash shell environment
- sudo privileges for system modifications
- Basic understanding of Linux administration

### Quick Deployment
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Emslyyy/sysadmin-automation-pack.git
   cd sysadmin-automation-pack/scripts
   ```

2. **Make the scripts executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

3. **Run each script individually:**
   ```bash
   ./secure_user_baseline.sh
   ./service_monitor.sh
   ./package_audit.sh
   ```

üìå **Note:** All scripts require bash and sudo privileges to run properly.

üñºÔ∏è **Visual documentation:** All script outputs and results can be viewed in the `screenshots/` directory.

## üõ°Ô∏è Script Implementation & Results

### Script 1: User Security Baseline

**Purpose:** Harden user accounts and implement security baselines across the system.

![Secure User Baseline Script](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35233cfc-d314-45e7-a6df-fbac55a3d184)

*Script development and configuration in vim editor*

**Key Features:**
- Lock unused system accounts (games, ftp, mail, etc.)
- Enforce password complexity requirements
- Set account lockout policies
- Create hardened user templates
- Audit existing user permissions

![User Account Locking](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dd9310f-6b53-41a9-b45a-1f4c905b3f35)

*Automated locking of unnecessary system accounts*

**Security Improvements:**
- Reduces attack surface by disabling unused accounts
- Implements password policies aligned with security standards
- Creates audit trail for user account changes
- Establishes baseline security configuration

*Successful execution showing hardened user security baseline*

### Script 2: Service Monitor

**Purpose:** Automated monitoring and management of critical system services.

**Monitoring Capabilities:**
- Track SSH daemon status and availability
- Monitor firewalld service health
- Automatic service restart on failure
- Logging of service status changes
- Integration with cron for scheduled monitoring

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0acf6ba3-2157-46e4-b658-1e65df7499f7)
*Real-time service monitoring output showing system health*

**Automation Features:**
- Proactive service health checking
- Automatic remediation of failed services
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Configurable monitoring intervals
- Email notifications on service failures

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4aedd712-b170-4435-97dd-1de1e5f6010d)

## üîç Technical Implementation Details

### Script Architecture

**Common Design Patterns:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Error handling and logging
set -euo pipefail
exec 1> >(tee -a /var/log/automation.log)
exec 2>&1

# Function definitions
log_message() {
    echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] $1"
}

# Main execution with error handling
main() {
    log_message "Starting automation script..."
    # Implementation logic
    log_message "Script completed successfully"
}

main "$@"
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Input validation and sanitization
- Privilege escalation controls
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails
- Rollback mechanisms for critical changes
- Configuration backup before modifications

### Integration & Scheduling

**Cron Integration:**
```bash
# Daily security baseline check
0 2 * * * /opt/scripts/secure_user_baseline.sh

# Service monitoring every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /opt/scripts/service_monitor.sh

# Weekly package audit
0 1 * * 0 /opt/scripts/package_audit.sh
```


## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Permission Denied** | Script fails with access errors | Run with sudo or check file permissions |
| **Service Not Found** | systemctl commands fail | Verify service names and availability |
| **Package Manager Lock** | DNF operations fail | Wait for other package operations to complete |
| **Log File Errors** | Cannot write to log files | Check log directory permissions |
| **Cron Job Failures** | Scheduled tasks not executing | Verify cron service and user permissions |
